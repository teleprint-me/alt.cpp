 * Overview:
 * This library provides a comprehensive and efficient Vector and Matrix API designed for high
 * performance and ease of use in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning
 * applications. It emphasizes simplicity, speed, and flexibility, leveraging pure C for core
 * operations to ensure maximum compatibility and performance. Advanced mathematical operations and
 * transformations are supported with minimal dependency on external libraries, adhering to a
 * philosophy of lightweight and focused design.
 *
 * Note:
 * - Prefixing related objects, functions, etc., has been adopted to enhance code readability and
 * assist with autocomplete features in various development environments. This convention is
 * intended to streamline development workflows and facilitate quick integration into existing
 * projects.
 *
 * This API stands as a testament to the power and flexibility of C, aiming to provide developers
 * with a robust toolkit for tackling a broad spectrum of computational challenges.

 *
 * Overview:
 * This library provides a comprehensive and efficient Vector and Matrix API designed for high
 * performance and ease of use in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning
 * applications. It emphasizes simplicity, speed, and flexibility, leveraging pure C for core
 * operations to ensure maximum compatibility and performance. Advanced mathematical operations and
 * transformations are supported with minimal dependency on external libraries, adhering to a
 * philosophy of lightweight and focused design.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Dynamic creation and management of vectors and matrices with support for deep copying and
 * cloning.
 * - A suite of mathematical operations, including vector normalization, magnitude calculation, and
 * a variety of element-wise operations for flexible data manipulation.
 * - Advanced vector operations such as dot and cross products, alongside essential functions for
 * coordinate transformation, providing the tools necessary for complex spatial and algebraic
 * calculations.
 * - Specialized functions for machine learning applications, including softmax activation and
 * cross-entropy loss calculation, facilitating the development of algorithms and models directly in
 * C.
 * - Utility functions for common tasks such as vector scaling and distance calculation, enhancing
 * the library's applicability to a wide range of computational problems.
 *
 * Usage Guidelines:
 * - This API is designed to be intuitive for users familiar with vector and matrix operations.
 * Function names and parameters follow conventional mathematical notation where possible.
 * - Users are encouraged to leverage the element-wise operation function to extend the library's
 * functionality and implement custom operations as needed.
 * - While the library aims to operate purely in C, certain operations may require linking against
 * standard math libraries (e.g., -lm on Unix-like systems) for complex mathematical functions.
 * - For best performance, attention should be paid to memory management practices, especially in
 * applications requiring intensive computational resources or running on constrained hardware.
 *
 * Note:
 * - Prefixing related objects, functions, etc., has been adopted to enhance code readability and
 * assist with autocomplete features in various development environments. This convention is
 * intended to streamline development workflows and facilitate quick integration into existing
 * projects.
 *
 * This API stands as a testament to the power and flexibility of C, aiming to provide developers
 * with a robust toolkit for tackling a broad spectrum of computational challenges.
